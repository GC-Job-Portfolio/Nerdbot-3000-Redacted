Bot was designed to monitor chat for certain commands; if !Naughty was entered would remove a specific member from certain chats for a specified amount of time (or 5 minutes by default), if !Nice was entered the member would rejoin those chats early, and if !Timeout was entered the status of the member would be displayed.

Personal project, included here as it demonstrates familiarity with asynchronous programming in python and hopefully passion for the field. Bot was designed to monitor chat for certain commands; if !Naughty was entered a target member would have 2 roles removed and another added for a specified amount of time, if !Nice was entered the roles would be returned, and if !Timeout was entered the status of the target member would be displayed. By adding/removing these roles, access to certain chats could be granted or restricted. Names have been made generic to avoid uneccessary confusion or complication.
